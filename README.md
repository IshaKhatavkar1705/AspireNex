## Task 1 - Credit Card Fraud Detection

Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

## Task 2 - Movie Genre Classification

Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. You can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.

## Task 3 - Credit Card Fraud Detection

Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
